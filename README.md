## Overview

This repository contains the scripts and code used to generate the figures and data reported in the thesis titled "Advancements in Bottom-Up Proteomics: Generation of PseudoDDA Spectra from DIA Data". The repository also includes the MarDIA program developed as part of this research.

## Repository Structure

- `DIA_Umpire/`: This directory contains all pseudoDDA data generated with DIA-Umpire. It also contains an example of the parameter file used, here for Sbrodae dataset. used to generate the figures and analyze the data presented in the thesis.
- `MarDIA1/`: This directory contains the MarDIA program files for all versions, the pseudoDDA spectra generated and all relevant information about the program.

## Input Data

The input data used for this research is not included in this repository due to size constraints and data sharing policies. However, the data is available upon request. Please contact Martin Vennick Haugbølle at s215073@dtu.dk to request access to the raw MS data.

## Usage

### Scripts

To run the scripts provided in the `scripts/` directory:

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can find a list of dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
2. Run the scripts in the desired order as specified in the thesis or in the comments within each script.

### MarDIA Program

To use the MarDIA program:

1. Navigate to the `MarDIA/` directory.
2. Follow the instructions provided in `MarDIA_README.md` to install and run the program.

## Requirements

The scripts and MarDIA program require the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
